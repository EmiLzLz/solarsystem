                    <h1>ABOUT THE SUN</h1>
                    <p>
                        The Sun is the most important star of the system that gives it its name, 
                        and being so essential for life on our planet, it has historically been 
                        part of the symbolism of all cultures around the world.
                        It is in good company: the Milky Way alone has more than 200,000 million stars, 
                        and the Sun is one of them. All the stars we can see with the naked eye 
                        are in the Milky Way.

                    <h1>WHY THAT NAME?</h1>
                    <p>
                        The word Sun has its origin in the Latin term sol, solis, which meant 
                        exactly the same thing: Sun, the luminous star, center of our planetary system.
                        <br> <br>
                        Some related Latin words are solium, which means "throne, seat" -perhaps 
                        that is why the Romans called our star the chariot or throne of Apollo, 
                        and the Egyptians, the chariot of Amun-; solus, single, unique; 
                        and solidus, solid, consistent. The root goes back to the pre-Sanskrit s√ª, 
                        which means "he who generates life."

                    <h1>THE MOST INTERESTING FACT</h1>
                    <p>
                        The Sun was born, it changes and unfortunately, it is a fact that the Sun is going 
                        to die, destroying the entire Solar System with its fall. Every 10 billion years 
                        it becomes 10% brighter and as this happens, life on Earth as we know it is becoming 
                        more and more difficult and this will continue until our planet will be practically 
                        water.
