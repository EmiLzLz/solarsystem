                    <h1>ABOUT URANUS</h1>
                    <p>
                        Uranus was already known in prehistoric times, but it was not understood that it was a planet. 
                        So it was not discovered until 1781.
                        <br>
                        It is the third largest planet in our solar system, four times larger than the 
                        Earth, and the seventh farthest planet from the Sun 
                        (Uranus makes one complete revolution of the Sun every 84 Earth years). 
                        Its characteristic bluish-green color is due to the methane clouds that move 
                        across its surface, where temperatures can reach values below -200 Â°C.

                    <h1>WHY THAT NAME?</h1>
                    <p>
                        The name was in honor of the British King George III. The reality is that the name was 
                        not well received elsewhere in the world. Johann Bode suggested the name Uranus 
                        (whose name is from Greek mythology) and it was accepted fairly quickly, back in 1850.
                        <br> <br>
                        Finally it was the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode who coined and opted for 
                        the Latinized version of the Greek mythological sky god "Uranus", father of Cronus 
                        (whose Roman equivalent named Saturn), on the grounds that since Saturn was the 
                        father of Jupiter, it was only logical that the new planet should 
                        be named after Saturn's father.

                    <h1>THE MOST INTERESTING FACT</h1>
                    <p>
                        Uranus is so tilted that it orbits the sun sideways. This tilt causes extreme 
                        seasons on the planet. 
                        That is, for a quarter of the Uranian year (equivalent to 84 Earth years) 
                        the sun shines directly over each pole. Thus, the other half of the planet 
                        experiences a long, dark and icy winter. In addition, Uranus has the coldest 
                        atmosphere of all the planets in the solar system. This is because it has little 
                        (or no) internal heat to supplement the heat from the Sun.
