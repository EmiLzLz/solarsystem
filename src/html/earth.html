                    <h1>ABOUT THE EARTH</h1>
                    <p>
                        Earth may be the only planet in our solar system that has oceans. 
                        It is the fifth largest planet in the solar system and perhaps the only one 
                        that harbors life.
                        Earth's seas and oceans, which cover 70% of its surface, are home to a great deal 
                        of life. With an average depth of 4 km, they account for 97% of the planet's water. 
                        Containing the Mid-oceanic Ridge, it lies deep beneath the sea. 
                        Four times longer than the Andes, the Rocky Mountains and the Himalayas in a row, 
                        it stretches 65,000 km across the Arctic and the Atlantic.

                    <h1>WHY THAT NAME?</h1>
                    <p>
                        The origins of the word are much debated and, over the years, scientists and experts 
                        have debunked or created new possible theories about the word.
                        <br> <br>
                        The name Terra comes from the Latin "Terra" which in turn derives from an 
                        Indo-European term meaning "dry part as opposed to the part with water". 
                        Even the poet Dante Alighieri, in the last canto of the Inferno 
                        (the first of the three canticles of The Divine Comedy), refers to our planet calling 
                        the Earth "The great Dry".

                    <h1>THE MOST INTERESTING FACT</h1>
                    <p>
                        Our planet does not really have the shape of a sphere, but a shape closer 
                        to an ellipse.
                        In addition, the Earth's ground is irregular and the mass of our planet is not 
                        distributed in a perfectly homogeneous way.
                        This causes variations in the value of the gravitational field.
                        Thus, for example, as we move from the equator towards the poles, the intensity 
                        of the gravitational field gradually increases, although the difference is 
                        imperceptible to humans.
