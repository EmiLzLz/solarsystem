                    <h1>ABOUT MARS</h1>
                    <p>
                        Mars is a cold desert planet. It is half the size of Earth, and is also called 
                        the "red planet". It is red because of the oxidized iron in its soil.
                        NASA's InSight lander has been on the surface of Mars since November 2018. 
                        It is part of the latest mission in a series aimed at determining whether Mars 
                        could one day host a human population.
                        Like Earth, Mars has seasons, ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. 
                        It has a thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon.

                    <h1>WHY THAT NAME?</h1>
                    <p>
                        It owes its name to the Roman god of war Mars. The red color of this planet, 
                        related to blood, favored that it was considered since ancient times as a symbol of 
                        the god of war, referring to Mars as the red planet.
                        <br> <br>
                        It is the fourth planet in the solar system closest to the sun and the second smallest 
                        in the solar system.
                        It should be noted that the names of the satellites belonging to this planet are the 
                        names of the sons of the Greek god.

                    <h1>THE MOST INTERESTING FACT</h1>
                    <p>
                        The novel The Martian (made into a movie with the title Mars) is right: it is possible 
                        to grow potatoes on the red planet, at least in theory. The science needed to do so 
                        is already in place: on the International Space Station (ISS) they use a "greenhouse" 
                        with LED lights, known as Veggie, to grow plants. 
                        <br><br>
                        Similar technology has proven very effective on Earth: in countries with a relative 
                        shortage of arable land, such as the Netherlands, LED lights are used to generate 
                        less heat and carbon dioxide emissions than conventional methods.
