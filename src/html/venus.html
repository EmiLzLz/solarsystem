                    <p>
                        It is the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures reaching 
                        470 Â°C, but at about 48 km altitude, where clouds form, the temperature plummets 
                        to levels similar to those on the Earth's surface.
                        The very high levels of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere, combined with the 
                        absence of surface water, mean that it cannot regulate its temperature, 
                        so it gets hotter and hotter.

                    <h1>WHY THAT NAME?</h1>
                    <p>
                        It is the third brightest celestial object in the sky (after the Sun and the Moon). 
                        It is even capable of casting shadows on the surface of our planet. 
                        Despite being a planet with hellish conditions, it was associated with the opposite.
                        <br> <br>
                        Its brightness, and its appearance at dawn, led the ancient Romans to associate 
                        the planet with Venus, the goddess of love and beauty. They were not the only ones 
                        to be guided by such impressions, for the ancient Greeks associated it with its 
                        equivalent, Aphrodite.

                    <h1>THE MOST INTERESTING FACT</h1>
                    <p>
                        We know that Venus is a totally hostile planet for life, except for what we know 
                        as extremophile organisms, and its hurricane winds are a clear example of this.
                        <br><br>
                        Winds can reach up to 724 kilometers per hour. To give you an idea, 
                        the tornadoes that occur on Earth have average speeds of 180 kilometers per hour.
                        In addition, Venus has been tilted so much that it is almost completely upside down, 
                        to a net tilt of less than three degrees to the sun, so the seasonal effect 
                        is negligible.
