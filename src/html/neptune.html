                    <h1>ABOUT NEPTUNE</h1>
                    <p>
                        Located 4300 million km from Earth at its closest point, Neptune is the 
                        farthest planet from the Sun, so it is not surprising that the great ice 
                        giant is an inhospitable wasteland. It receives hardly any light or heat, 
                        so its average temperature is about -200 °C. On Neptune, 
                        a year lasts 165 Earth years. Its long summers and 40-year winters allow a 
                        moderate warming of 10 °C at the poles.

                    <h1>WHY THAT NAME?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Shortly after its discovery, Neptune was called, simply, "the planet that 
                        follows Uranus" or "Le Verrier's planet".
                        <br> <br>
                        While Le Verrier suggested Neptune for the new planet. Struve came out in favor 
                        of that name on December 29, 1846, at the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. 
                        In Roman mythology, Neptune was the god of the sea, identified with the Greek 
                        Poseidon. The demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the 
                        nomenclature of the other planets, which were all named after Roman deities.

                    <h1>THE MOST INTERESTING FACT</h1>
                    <p>
                        As is usually the case with large planets, Neptune has a large number of 
                        satellites. Experts have identified 14 moons, although the number could be 
                        higher as it has not been definitively closed.
                        <br>
                        Of these moons, Triton is the only one that is completely spherical in shape 
                        and is believed to have originally been a dwarf planet that eventually yielded 
                        to the pull of the icy giant's gravity field.
                        It has been confirmed that Triton is a rocky and icy body, which makes it very 
                        similar to Pluto, and that it also has volcanic activity.
