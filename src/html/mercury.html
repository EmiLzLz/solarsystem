                    <h1>ABOUT MERCURY</h1>
                    <p>
                        It is the closest to the Sun; it revolves around it at an average speed of 
                        170,505 km/h and takes only 88 days to complete one revolution, so that each 
                        year of the Earth is equivalent to more than four years of Mercury.
                        Because of its proximity to our star, from the surface of Mercury our Sun 
                        would be seen 3 times larger than from Earth, and its brightness would be up 
                        to 7 times higher.
                        It was already known at least since the time of the Sumerians, 5,000 years ago.

                    <h1>WHY THAT NAME?</h1>
                    <p>
                        The Greeks named it Hermes, in honor of the messenger of the Olympian gods, 
                        who was later known by the Romans as Mercury, the name by which it has survived 
                        to the present day.
                        <br> <br>
                        The name of this planet is no coincidence because, just as Mercury was the 
                        fastest of the gods of Olympus, with a speed of 170,5030 kilometers per hour, 
                        the planet Mercury is the one that travels the fastest through space in our 
                        solar system.

                    <h1>THE MOST INTERESTING FACT</h1>
                    <p>
                        Since Mercury has no atmosphere, the asteroids that reach the planet hit it without 
                        any resistance. The result: formation of large craters. 
                        An example of a crater resulting from an asteroid impact 4 billion years ago is the 
                        Caloris Basin. It is believed that the 100 km wide asteroid that caused the impact 
                        hit Mercury with a force similar to that produced by a trillion bombs of one megaton 
                        each.
