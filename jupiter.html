                    <p>
                        Eleven times larger than Earth, Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. 
                        Its surface is covered with cloud bands that extend into deep layers. 
                        Its atmosphere is rich in hydrogen, yet conditions on its surface must be more like 
                        the end of a world than its beginning. Of the huge storms that plague much of the 
                        planet, the most famous is the Great Red Spot, which is believed to have formed more 
                        than 300 years ago.

                    <h1>WHY THAT NAME?</h1>
                    <p>
                        The name Jupiter raises two possibilities regarding its etymology, on the one hand, 
                        there are those who claim that it has its origin in the Latin root "iovis".
                        <br> <br>
                        However, others say that this voice is composed of the Indo-European roots "iu" 
                        meaning "light", and "pater", meaning "father", so that its etymological 
                        interpretation would be understood as "father of light". It should be remembered that 
                        according to Roman mythology, Jupiter is the greatest of the gods, father of the 
                        other deities and of humanity.

                    <h1>THE MOST INTERESTING FACT</h1>
                    <p>
                        One consequence of Jupiter's large size is its extreme gravity, so powerful that 
                        it causes the planet to contract. Its internal matter is compressed, generating both 
                        immense friction and enormous amounts of heat. In fact, Jupiter emits more heat 
                        than it receives from the Sun.
